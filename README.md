#  âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{pink}The Dream }}$ âœ¨
To Create a c# API backend and connect it to a react frontend!


# âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{pink}Development Week }}$ âœ¨


## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 1 }}$
* :hibiscus: Created the DbScript that genrates the tables in Microsoft SQL Server as well as create the queries to insert dummy data into the database.
* :hibiscus: Connected API project to the database and generated the Models for the backend application.      
* :hibiscus: Created the controllers and DTOs (Data Transfer Object) and services for each model so that they can be used in the frontend. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 2 }}$                       
:hibiscus: Finshed up on adding the controllers and DTOs (Data Transfer Object) and services for each model so that they can be used in the frontend. 
:hibiscus: Started unit testing each contoller to ensure the backend works as intended - all CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality, using XUnit. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 3 }}$                       
:hibiscus: Finshed unit testing each contoller to ensure the backend works as intended - all CRUD functionality using XUint.                             
:hibiscus: Started to connect each frontend with the API backend to select the most stable front end for the project - Toby's.           
:hibiscus: Worked on incorporating JWT authentication into the project so that users can login and have permissions to see only certain components. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 4 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Added a login screen for authentication.                                                                                            
ðŸŒº Fixed issues with deleting a property if it has any bookings associated to the property that is to be deleted.                                   
ðŸŒº Started to create the presentation slides. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 5}}$                       
:hibiscus: Last miniute structuring.                                                                                                                                     
:hibiscus: Going over presentation.

## âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{#FF1493}Roles}}$ âœ¨

# âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{#FF1493}Development Week }}$ âœ¨


## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 1 }}$
ðŸŒº Created the DbScript that genrates the tables in Microsoft SQL Server as well as create the queries to insert dummy data into the database.
ðŸŒº Connected API project to the database and generated the Models for the backend application.      
ðŸŒº Created the controllers and DTOs (Data Transfer Object) and services for each model so that they can be used in the frontend. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 2 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Finshed up on adding the controllers and DTOs (Data Transfer Object) and services for each model so that they can be used in the frontend. 
ðŸŒº Started unit testing each contoller to ensure the backend works as intended - all CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality, using XUnit. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 3 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Finshed unit testing each contoller to ensure the backend works as intended - all CRUD functionality using XUint.                             
ðŸŒº Started to connect each frontend with the API backend to select the most stable front end for the project - Toby's.           
ðŸŒº Worked on incorporating JWT authentication into the project so that users can login and have permissions to see only certain components. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 4 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Added a login screen for authentication.                                                                                            
ðŸŒº Fixed issues with deleting a property if it has any bookings associated to the property that is to be deleted.                                   
ðŸŒº Started to create the presentation slides. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 5}}$                       
ðŸŒº Last miniute structuring.                                                                                                                                     
ðŸŒº Going over presentation.                                                                                                                                          
ðŸŒº Presentation time.




# âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{#FF1493}Things to look at next iteration }}$ âœ¨ ðŸ‘€
- Login/Log out authentication display in frontend i.e. personalised navbar user logo or message display such as using Toast to make UI friendly messages for errors 
- Images within SQL db for displaying properties instead of placeholde images
- Re-designing the database to have either:
  - - Users and then set roles for both buyers and sellers
  - - having permissions
  - -creating an adress table that will reference each user
  - - Having the adress input split into seperate fields i.e adress would become
    - house/apartment number
    - street name
    - city

# âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{#FF1493}Issues Faced }}$ âœ¨ 

:rage: Git merge conflicts.                                                                                                                              
:rage: Branch Deviations and general tidyness of these.                                                                                                                         
:rage: Passing information of backend to the frontend.
:rage: Database first approach caused problems with relationships and foreign keys.                                                                                          
:rage: Delete Method-implementation of cascading delete.

ðŸŒº Fixed issues quickly. 
ðŸŒº Collabaration on issues and ideas.   
ðŸŒº Git was a useful and structured rescource.

#  âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{#EF5395}The Dream }}$ âœ¨
To Create a C# API backend and connect it to a React frontend!


# âœ¨ ${\textsf{\color{#F56991}Development Week }}$ âœ¨


## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 1 }}$
ðŸŒº Created the DbScript that genrates the tables in Microsoft SQL Server as well as create the queries to insert dummy data into the database.
ðŸŒº Connected API project to the database and generated the Models for the backend application.      
ðŸŒº Created the controllers and DTOs (Data Transfer Object) and services for each model so that they can be used in the frontend. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 2 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Finshed up on adding the controllers and DTOs (Data Transfer Object) and services for each model so that they can be used in the frontend. 
ðŸŒº Started unit testing each contoller to ensure the backend works as intended - all CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality, using XUnit. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 3 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Finshed unit testing each contoller to ensure the backend works as intended - all CRUD functionality using XUint.                             
ðŸŒº Started to connect each frontend with the API backend to select the most stable front end for the project - Toby's.           
ðŸŒº Worked on incorporating JWT authentication into the project so that users can login and have permissions to see only certain components. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 4 }}$                       
ðŸŒº Added a login screen for authentication.                                                                                            
ðŸŒº Fixed issues with deleting a property if it has any bookings associated to the property that is to be deleted.                                   
ðŸŒº Started to create the presentation slides. 

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Day 5}}$                       
ðŸŒº Last miniute structuring.                                                                                                                                     
ðŸŒº Going over presentation.

ðŸŒº Passing information of backend to the frontend.
ðŸŒº Database first approach caused problems with relationships and foreign keys.
